rsync (3.2.6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 3.2.6
    - Added a safety check that prevents the sender from removing destination
      files when a local copy using --remove-source-files has some files that
      are shared between the sending & receiving hierarchies, including the
      case where the source dir & destination dir are identical
      (closes: #1016102)
  * Bump Standards-Version to 4.6.1

rsync (3.2.5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 3.2.5
    - Added some file-list safety checking that helps to ensure that a rogue
      sending rsync can't add unrequested top-level names and/or include
      recursive names that should have been excluded by the sender. These
      extra safety checks only require the receiver rsync to be updated. When
      dealing with an untrusted sending host, it is safest to copy into a
      dedicated destination directory for the remote content (i.e. don't copy
      into a destination directory that contains files that aren't from the
      remote host unless you trust the remote host)
      (closes: #1016543, CVE-2022-29154).
    - The build date that goes into the manpages is now based on the
      developer's release date, not on the build's local-timezone
      interpretation of the date (closes: #1009981)

    - rsync.1: remove prepended backticks which broke --stop-after and
      --stop-at formatting (closes: #1007990).
  * Ship new python-based rrsync with --with-rrsync:
    - rrsync was previouysly written in bash.
    - A manpage is now shipped for rrsync.
    - python3 and python3-cmarkgfm are new B-Ds since they're needed
      to generate the manpage.
  * d/control:

      per upstream docs.
    - Add python3-braceexpand to Suggests as it can be used by rrsync.

    - Refresh the following patches:

  [ Sergio Durigan Junior ]
  * d/rules: Disable ASM optimizations when building.
    This is not needed because the only ASM-optimized implementation
    available is the MD5 hash, which is actually a no-op because we link
    against OpenSSL and rsync ends up using that library's implementation
    of the hash.  Even then, the final binary ends up with the
    ASM-optimized version included, which makes it become
    CET-incompatible.

rsync (2.6.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream version.
    closes:#357314
  * Includes a patch for an exclude bug when dealing with --relative
    while copying an absolute path. This bug will lead to 2.6.8 being released
    within the next couple of weeks, but this way 2.6.7 can get some Debian
    exposure before then.

rsync (2.6.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream version.
    bug-fix release to handle a null-pointer bug that turned up in rsync's
    version of zlib 1.1.4 (this is not the recent zlib 1.2.2 security fix,
    which did not affect rsync) and to squash a few other minor bugs.  To deal
    with the zlib issue, rsync has been upgraded to include zlib 1.2.3.
  * Now use the --min-size patch as included by upstream, instead of the
    (minimally different) Debian patch.
  * Fixed some minor typos in the manpage.
    closes:#309100
  * Clarified text about pidfile in sample rsyncd.conf.

    Contains the patches previously applied in 2.6.4-3 from CVS.
  * Now should handle locale-specific characters better in logging output

 -- Paul Slootman <paul@debian.org>  Fri,  3 Jun 2005 19:17:28 +0200

rsync (2.6.4-6) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fixed grave bug:
    replaced the Debian-specific patch to log.c with the upstream CVS version,
    as upstream changes conflict with the Debian patch, causing syslog logging
    (the default!) to fail, meaning that for most people the rsync as daemon
    doesn't work.
    This includes people using systemimager-server, as that generates the
    rsyncd.conf on the fly without a log file line, hence the rsync bug
    causes a total failure of that package.
    closes:#307923,#308428
  * fixed the rsync.1 manpage, where cut&paste from a diff was not done
    correctly (the leading '+'s were still there).

    yourself.

    finding them.

  * Removed a double line from the man page left behind while editing.
    closes:#282148

    when using small bwlimit values. Use --bwlimit-mod instead of --bwlimit.
    Note that this needs an rsync version at both ends that has this
    modification. See bug 191557 for more info.
  * Removed own kludge to fix #146045 (interrupting while ssh is asking for a
    password leaves tty in non-echoing state) as upstream rsync now has its
    own kludge for this in another place.
  * Added init.d script for those who want to start rsync in daemon mode
    automatically. You'll need to edit /etc/default/rsync and create an

rsync (2.6.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Year's Day official release of 2.6.0.
  * In short, the most important points from NEWS:
  * - ssh is now the default remote shell for rsync.
  * - Added --files-from, --no-relative, --no-implied-dirs, and --from0.
  * - Fixed several exclude/include matching bugs when using wild-cards.
      Please check the NEWS file for details on subtle changes in
      exclude/include matching.
  * - Make --link-dest honor the absence of -p, -o, and -g.
  * - Fixed file I/O error detection.
  * - Improved file-related error messages to better indicate exactly what
      pathname failed.
  * - Fixed bug that prevented regular files from replacing special files and
      caused a directory in --link-dest or --compare-dest to block the creation
      of a file with the same path.  A directory still cannot be replaced by a
      regular file unless --delete specified.  (J.W. Schultz)
